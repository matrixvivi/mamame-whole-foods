                <p>Mamame Whole Foods was born out of a Mama's big love. Our family lived in Jakarta, Indonesia for over 20 years, and in that time, Mama raised two children by feeding them with the most delicious foods that nature had to offer.</p>
                <p>In every meal she cooked, she brought the elements of the earth to the table — in the form of plant-based Asian foods like natto, tofu, and tempeh.</p>
                <p>Blessed by gifts of the local culture that surrounded us, these foods showed us delicious ways we could eat while considering both the health of the environment, and ourselves.</p>
                <p>Mamame's hope is that our healthy foods will reach the kitchens and pantries of you and your loved ones with the intention to care and nourish — for both the earth, and our bodies.</p>
