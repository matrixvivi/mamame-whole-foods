                    <p>While Indonesian tempeh leaves a strong, sometimes bitter aftertaste from the soybeans, our patented recipe targets anyone who enjoys a crispy, savoury snack.</p>

                    <p>We source non-GMO black-eyed beans, lentils, and chia seeds for our tempeh.</p>
                    <p>Upon washing, boiling, and fermenting the beans under a sealed tempered environment, we add a tempeh starter and some tapioca flour and ferment it further for 30-33 hours.</p>
                    <p>We then cook all our chips in coconut oil, a healthier alternative to highly-processed manufactured oils without compromising crunch, texture, or flavor.</p>
